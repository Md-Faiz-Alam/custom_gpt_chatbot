### Explanation:

1.  **Operation Functions**: We start by defining separate functions for each of the four basic arithmetic operations: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. These functions take two arguments, `x` and `y`, and return the result of the corresponding operation.
2.  **Main Program Loop**: The calculator operates in an infinite loop, allowing users to perform calculations until they choose to quit.
3.  **User Interface**: Inside the loop, we display a simple menu with options to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or quit the program.
4.  **User Input and Validation**: We prompt the user to choose an operation and validate their input to ensure it matches one of the available options. If the user chooses to quit, the program ends with a farewell message.
5.  **Perform Calculation**: Based on the user's choice, we ask for two numbers and then perform the selected operation by calling the corresponding function with these numbers as arguments. The result is then printed to the console.
6.  **Error Handling**: For division, we check if the second number (`y`) is zero to prevent a division-by-zero error. If `y` is zero, we display an error message instead of attempting the division.

### Example Use Cases:

*   **Addition**:

    *   User chooses operation 1 (Addition).
    *   Enters the first number: `10`.
    *   Enters the second number: `5`.
    *   Calculator displays: `10 + 5 = 15.0`.
*   **Subtraction**:

    *   User chooses operation 2 (Subtraction).
    *   Enters the first number: `20`.
    *   Enters the second number: `8`.
    *   Calculator displays: `20 - 8 = 12.0`.
*   **Multiplication**:

    *   User chooses operation 3 (Multiplication).
    *   Enters the first number: `4`.
    *   Enters the second number: `9`.
    *   Calculator displays: `4 * 9 = 36.0`.
*   **Division**:

    *   User chooses operation 4 (Division).
    *   Enters the first number: `12`.
    *   Enters the second number: `3`.
    *   Calculator displays: `12 / 3 = 4.0`.
*   **Division by Zero**:

    *   User chooses operation 4 (Division).
    *   Enters the first number: `5`.
    *   Enters the second number: `0`.
    *   Calculator displays: `Error: Division by zero is not allowed.`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Function Definitions**:
    *   The code starts by defining four functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. Each function takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns the result of the corresponding operation.
    *   For example, the `add` function takes two numbers, `x` and `y`, and returns their sum: `x + y`.
2.  **Main Program Loop**:
    *   The program then enters an infinite loop (`while True`) that continues until the user chooses to quit.
    *   Inside the loop, it displays a simple menu with options to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or quit the program.
3.  **User Input and Validation**:
    *   The program prompts the user to choose an operation by entering a number between 1 and 5.
    *   If the user chooses to quit (option 5), the program prints a goodbye message and breaks out of the loop using the `break` statement.
    *   If the user enters an invalid choice (not between 1 and 5), the program prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
4.  **Operation Selection and Execution**:
    *   If the user enters a valid choice (1, 2, 3, or 4), the program asks for two numbers: `num1` and `num2`.
    *   Based on the user's choice, it calls the corresponding function with `num1` and `num2` as arguments and prints the result.
    *   For example, if the user chooses addition (option 1), the program calls the `add` function with `num1` and `num2` as arguments and prints the result: `num1 + num2 = result`.
5.  **Division by Zero Handling**:
    *   The `divide` function checks if the second number (`y`) is zero to prevent a division-by-zero error.
    *   If `y` is zero, the function returns an error message instead of attempting the division.

**Example Use Cases:**

*   **Addition**:
    *   User chooses option 1 (Addition).
    *   Enters the first number: `10`.
    *   Enters the second number: `5`.
    *   Program prints: `10 + 5 = 15.0`.
*   **Subtraction**:
    *   User chooses option 2 (Subtraction).
    *   Enters the first number: `20`.
    *   Enters the second number: `8`.
    *   Program prints: `20 - 8 = 12.0`.
*   **Multiplication**:
    *   User chooses option 3 (Multiplication).
    *   Enters the first number: `4`.
    *   Enters the second number: `9`.
    *   Program prints: `4 * 9 = 36.0`.
*   **Division**:
    *   User chooses option 4 (Division).
    *   Enters the first number: `12`.
    *   Enters the second number: `3`.
    *   Program prints: `12 / 3 = 4.0`.
*   **Division by Zero**:
    *   User chooses option 4 (Division).
    *   Enters the first number: `5`.
    *   Enters the second number: `0`.
    *   Program prints: `Error: Division by zero is not allowed.`.

**Explanation:**

1.  **Function Definitions**:
    *   The code defines four functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. Each function performs a basic arithmetic operation.
    *   For example, the `add` function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
2.  **Main Program Loop**:
    *   The program enters an infinite loop (`while True`) that continues until the user chooses to quit.
    *   Inside the loop, it displays a menu with options to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or quit the program.
3.  **User Input and Validation**:
    *   The program prompts the user to choose an operation by entering a number between 1 and 5.
    *   If the user chooses to quit (option 5), the program prints a goodbye message and breaks out of the loop using the `break` statement.
    *   If the user enters an invalid choice (not between 1 and 5), the program prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
4.  **Operation Selection and Execution**:
    *   If the user enters a valid choice (1, 2, 3, or 4), the program asks for two numbers: `num1` and `num2`.
    *   Based on the user's choice, it calls the corresponding function with `num1` and `num2` as arguments and prints the result.
    *   For example, if the user chooses addition (option 1), the program calls the `add` function with `num1` and `num2` as arguments and prints the result: `num1 + num2 = result`.
5.  **Division by Zero Handling**:
    *   The `divide` function checks if the second number (`y`) is zero to prevent a division-by-zero error.
    *   If `y` is zero, the function returns an error message instead of attempting the division.

**Example Use Cases:**

*   **Addition**:
    *   User chooses option 1 (Addition).
    *   Enters the first number: `10`.
    *   Enters the second number: `5`.
    *   Program prints: `10 + 5 = 15.0`.
*   **Subtraction**:
    *   User chooses option 2 (Subtraction).
    *   Enters the first number: `20`.
    *   Enters the second number: `8`.
    *   Program prints: `20 - 8 = 12.0`.
*   **Multiplication**:
    *   User chooses option 3 (Multiplication).
    *   Enters the first number: `4`.
    *   Enters the second number: `9`.
    *   Program prints: `4 * 9 = 36.0`.
*   **Division**:
    *   User chooses option 4 (Division).
    *   Enters the first number: `12`.
    *   Enters the second number: `3`.
    *   Program prints: `12 / 3 = 4.0`.
*   **Division by Zero**:
    *   User chooses option 4 (Division).
    *   Enters the first number: `5`.
    *   Enters the second number: `0`.
    *   Program prints: `Error: Division by zero is not allowed.`.

This code implements a simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1.  Define the functions for each operation.
2.  Create a main program loop that displays a menu and gets user input.
3.  Validate the user's choice and handle invalid input.
4.  Call the corresponding function based on the user's choice and print the result.
5.  Handle division by zero errors.

**Advice:**

*   Use descriptive variable names and comments to make the code easy to understand.
*   Test the code thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
*   Consider adding more features to the calculator, such as handling multiple operators or supporting more advanced math operations.
