[2025-10-02 14:05:20,500] CustomBot - INFO - Assistant: To learn Generative AI, follow this roadmap:

1. **Math**: Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability
2. **Programming**: Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow
3. **Deep Learning**: Coursera, Stanford CS231n
4. **Generative Models**: GANs, VAEs, Transformers (research papers, tutorials)
5. **Projects**: Implement models, experiment with datasets
6. **Specialize**: Focus on areas like image, text, or music generation
7. **Stay updated**: Follow research, blogs, and conferences (e.g., NIPS, ICLR)
