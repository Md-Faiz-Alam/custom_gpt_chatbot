[2025-09-26 16:23:42,550] CustomBot - INFO - Assistant: **Calculator Code in Python**
=====================================

Below is a simple implementation of a calculator in Python:

```python
# calculator.py

def add(x, y):
    """Return the sum of x and y"""
    return x + y

def subtract(x, y):
    """Return the difference of x and y"""
    return x - y

def multiply(x, y):
    """Return the product of x and y"""
    return x * y

def divide(x, y):
    """Return the quotient of x and y"""
    if y == 0:
        return "Error: Division by zero"
    return x / y

def calculator():
    print("Simple Calculator")
    print("1. Addition")
    print("2. Subtraction")
    print("3. Multiplication")
    print("4. Division")

    choice = input("Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): ")

    if choice in ('1', '2', '3', '4'):
        num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
        num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

        if choice == '1':
            print(num1, "+", num2, "=", add(num1, num2))
        elif choice == '2':
            print(num1, "-", num2, "=", subtract(num1, num2))
        elif choice == '3':
            print(num1, "*", num2, "=", multiply(num1, num2))
        elif choice == '4':
            print(num1, "/", num2, "=", divide(num1, num2))
    else:
        print("Invalid choice")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    calculator()
```

**How it works:**

1. The code defines four functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`, each performing a basic arithmetic operation.
2. The `calculator` function is the main entry point. It prompts the user to choose an operation and input two numbers.
3. Based on the user's choice, the corresponding function is called with the input numbers, and the result is printed.

**Example Use Cases:**

* Addition: Enter `1` as the choice, then input `10` and `5` as the numbers. The output will be `10 + 5 = 15.0`.
* Subtraction: Enter `2` as the choice, then input `20` and `8` as the numbers. The output will be `20 - 8 = 12.0`.
* Multiplication: Enter `3` as the choice, then input `4` and `9` as the numbers. The output will be `4 * 9 = 36.0`.
* Division: Enter `4` as the choice, then input `12` and `3` as the numbers. The output will be `12 / 3 = 4.0`.

Note: This is a basic implementation, and you can enhance it by adding more features, such as handling invalid inputs or implementing more advanced arithmetic operations.
