[2025-09-26 23:17:45,725] CustomBot - INFO - Assistant: Here's a simple implementation of the Snake game in Python using the Pygame library.

**Game Description:**
The game is a single-player game where the player controls a snake that can move up, down, left, or right. The snake's goal is to eat the food pellets that appear on the screen. Each time the snake eats a food pellet, it grows longer. The game ends if the snake runs into the edge of the screen or into itself.

**Code:**

```python
import pygame
import sys
import random

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up some constants
WIDTH = 800
HEIGHT = 600
SPEED = 20

# Create the game screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))

# Set up the font
font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)

# Set up the snake
snake = [(200, 200), (220, 200), (240, 200)]
direction = 'right'

# Set up the food
food = (400, 300)

# Game loop
while True:
    # Handle events
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_UP and direction != 'down':
                direction = 'up'
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN and direction != 'up':
                direction = 'down'
            elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT and direction != 'right':
                direction = 'left'
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT and direction != 'left':
                direction = 'right'

    # Move the snake
    head = snake[-1]
    if direction == 'up':
        new_head = (head[0], head[1] - 20)
    elif direction == 'down':
        new_head = (head[0], head[1] + 20)
    elif direction == 'left':
        new_head = (head[0] - 20, head[1])
    elif direction == 'right':
        new_head = (head[0] + 20, head[1])

    snake.append(new_head)

    # Check for collision with the edge of the screen
    if (new_head[0] < 0 or new_head[0] >= WIDTH or
            new_head[1] < 0 or new_head[1] >= HEIGHT):
        print('Game over!')
        pygame.quit()
        sys.exit()

    # Check for collision with itself
    if new_head in snake[:-1]:
        print('Game over!')
        pygame.quit()
        sys.exit()

    # Check if the snake ate the food
    if new_head == food:
        # Generate new food
        food = (random.randint(0, WIDTH - 20) // 20 * 20,
                random.randint(0, HEIGHT - 20) // 20 * 20)
    else:
        # Remove the tail of the snake
        snake.pop(0)

    # Draw everything
    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
    for pos in snake:
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, (0, 255, 0), (pos[0], pos[1], 20, 20))
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, (255, 0, 0), (food[0], food[1], 20, 20))
    text = font.render(f'Score: {len(snake) - 3}', True, (255, 255, 255))
    screen.blit(text, (10, 10))

    # Update the display
    pygame.display.flip()

    # Cap the frame rate
    pygame.time.Clock().tick(SPEED)
```

**Explanation:**

1. The game uses a simple game loop that handles events, moves the snake, and draws everything on the screen.
2. The snake is represented as a list of positions, where each position is a pair of x and y coordinates.
3. The food is represented as a single position, which is a pair of x and y coordinates.
4. The game checks for collision with the edge of the screen and with itself.
5. If the snake eats the food, it generates new food and grows longer. Otherwise, it removes the tail of the snake.
6. The game draws everything on the screen, including the snake, the food, and the score.
7. The game uses a clock to cap the frame rate at 20 frames per second.

**Example Use Cases:**

* Run the game by executing the code.
* Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
* Eat the food pellets to grow longer.
* Avoid running into the edge of the screen or into yourself.

Note: This is a basic implementation of the Snake game, and you can add additional features such as levels, obstacles, and scoring.
